# VIDEO_XCHNG

It's an experimental video tool for VJs and experimental video artists that I think you are really going to dig. Think of it as a swiss army knife for joining all your old video gear together. 

  The "Video XCHNG" (Video Exchange) was created to expand the possibilities of working with analogue video gear by adding a number of features that will greatly improve the way you work with your vintage equipment.


                       These features include:
                       - Two x 2:1 switches, add two additional inputs to your video mixer
                       - A dirty mixer for creating distortion and disruption as your transition between two video inputs
                       - A passive sharpener to heighten the edges of your signal (a classic effect)
                       - A loop out/bypass function to switch from direct feedback to feedback with effects instantly
